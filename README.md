You are given a design board with two input pins A and B and three  output pins R, C.out and V. Build from gates a 6-bit signed-number  subtractor circuit, which subtracts B from A asserting the difference on  R and the carry-out on C.out. If subtraction causes a signed-number  overflow, your circuit must assert 1 on V, otherwise V should be low.
